# About || Raam || name

Spiritual upliftment of mankind in the form of liberation from the bondage of
repeated births and deaths is a proven reality when a human chants **RAAM RAAM**
with his inhale and exhale breathing as introduced by His Holiness **Ādi Sataguru
Sukharāma Jī Mahārāja**. Mahārāja brought this **Kaivalya-Jñāna** science. So one can
attain ultimate salvation while alive.
