# About || Raam || name

Spiritual upliftment of mankind in the form of liberation from the bondage of
repeated births and deaths is a proven reality when a human chants **RAAM RAAM**
with his inhale and exhale breathing as introduced by His Holiness **─Аdi Sataguru
Sukhar─Бma J─л Mah─Бr─Бja**. Mah─Бr─Бja brought this **Kaivalya-J├▒─Бna** science. So one can
attain ultimate salvation while alive.

THAT whose nature is true, which is not lacking in all three periods. It never
happened before, such a time has never come and will never come. Such a time
will never come. It is a home of joy, a home full of joy. Even its letter cannot
be pronounced. One whose name is told by the Sataguru for attaining salvation,
that knowledge (of THAT) comes within the heart with the secret, and with the
arrival of love and feelings for it, determination comes into the mind. This is
the only way to attain salvation. There is no other solution in the universe. ||
