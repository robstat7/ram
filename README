About || Raam || name
=====================

Spiritual upliftment of mankind in the form of liberation from the bondage of
repeated births and deaths is a proven reality when a human chants RAAM RAAM
with his inhale and exhale breathing as introduced by His Holiness Ādi Sataguru
Sukharāma Jī Mahārāja. Mahārāja brought this Kaivalya-Jñāna science. So one can
attain ultimate salvation while alive.
